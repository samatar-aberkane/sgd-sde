# sgd-sde
This project explores the relationship between the dynamics of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). Using Python simulations, it demonstrates how the inherent randomness of SGD acts like Brownian motion on the loss landscape, allowing the algorithm to find more generalized solutions.
